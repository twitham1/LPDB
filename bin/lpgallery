=head1 NAME

lpgallery - remote-control (keyboard) driven local picture browser

=head1 SYNOPSIS

lpgallery [startup file]

What would happen if all your pictures were available in just 1 local
file and all their metadata in another?  Any or all pictures could be
seen instantly and in any order.  This is that!

UNDER CONSTRUCTION - Picasa features don't yet exist!!!

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<lpgallery> presents local pictures (optionally managed by Picasa) in
a keyboard (or remote) controlled browser, similar to MythGallery of
MythTV.  The main window navigates a "virtual filesytem" thumbnail
tree of multiple organized paths to galleries of the images.  A second
window presents any one image at a time, optionally as an automatic
slide show.  Videos can be manually or automatically played as well.

Ideally this is run at full-screen on a big screen from the comfort of
your couch.  Currently this is read-only, it will never modify any
images.  The database is updated once from the filesystem in the
background at start up.

=head2 Thumbnail Grid

The main window is a grid of thumnail images.  Picture collections are
represented by a stack of three images: the oldest, center (or random)
and youngest picture in the path below that point in the tree.  Arrow
keys move around the grid while the B<Enter> key moves into a lower
path or presents a single picture.  The B<Escape> key moves back up to
the parent path.  Metadata about the selected path is displayed above
and below the grid.

Any videos are shown as a frame grab from the center of the video or
as a stack of 3 grabs at 5%, 50% and 95% of the time.  This can be
toggled with B<v>.  Either way the play time of the video is displayed
in the center of the video image.

All images can optionally be cropped to consume their whole square in
which case lines are overlayed that indicate displayed and missing
areas of the full image.

The top level virtual paths of the grid are:

=over

=item [Folders]

Literal filesystem layout of picture files.  Any directory containing
images is hereafter called a "gallery".  By default images remain
grouped in these physical gallery collections in all virtual paths
that follow unless the Sort -> Gallery Groups menu option is changed
to Ungrouped.

=item [Timeline]

Pictures grouped chronologically into years or months or even all
time.  Be patient with large selections as they take a while to sort.

=item [Captions]

caption strings found in EXIF picture metadata

=item [Tags]

tag strings found in EXIF picture metadata

=item [Albums]

pictures organized by Albums (Picasa only not implemented)

=item [People]

pictures of recognized named faces (Picasa only not implemented)

=item [Stars]

pictures marked with stars as favorites (Picasa only not implemented)

=back

=head2 Image Viewer

A second window opens when hitting B<Enter> on an image from the grid.
This displays one picture at maximum size for the window.  Arrow keys
will now navigate both windows.  The B<Enter> key will zoom to
original size.  Scroll with the arrow keys for images larger than the
window and hit B<Enter> again to toggle back to auto zoom best fit.
For video files B<Enter> instead plays the video, hit B<Escape> to
return when finished.

The B<i> key cycles through metadata "info" overlay levels.  This adds
common picture and camera metadata to the corners and (for Picasa
only) draws named rectangles around recognized faces.  Hit the B<d>
key to see all known metadata.

Finally, B<Escape> returns back to the thumbnail browser.

=head1 OPTIONS

In the Thumbnail Grid, the B<m> key brings up a Menu of options
including sorting, filtering, and navigating to other locations of
this picture in the tree.  In the Image Viewer, B<m> can start and
stop a slide show, adjust information overlay or show all metadata of
the image.  Refer to the menu to discover other keyboard shortcuts
like B<z> and B<q> to zoom in and out respectively in either window.

=head2 FILTERING

The grid menu provides options to select only pictures with certain
attributes or only those from a recent timeframe.  Filtering can cause
nodes in the tree to go blank where no pictures match.  Simply uncheck
the filters to restore access to all pictures.

=head2 SORTING

The sort menu is slightly complicated but provides great flexibility.
Sorts can be ascending or descending.  Sorting is done in the order of
the options presented:

=head3 Paths

First the virtual nodes in the paths of the tree can be sorted by
name, randomly or by the time of the first, middle or last picture
below this point in the tree.  The default is an alphabetical sort.

=head3 Gallery Groups

By default pictures remain grouped in their physical directory or
"gallery" which is displayed below the grid.  These galleries can be
sorted alphabetically or by the time of the first or last picture.
The I<Ungrouped> option is special: it breaks the gallery grouping and
lets all pictures sort together across all groups.

=head3 Images

Finally the images are sorted within their galleries, or as a whole if
Gallery Groups is set to I<Ungrouped>.  Sorting can be by filename,
size or time (default), or random.  The I<Fast> option is special in
that it does no sorting at all and returns the database order
immediately with no waiting.  This automatically assumes no gallery
grouping and reveals the order in which the images were added to the
database.

=head3 Mixed Folders

Within [Folders] you may have both images and directories in a
directory.  This simply chooses which to display first.

=head2 SLIDE SHOW

The B<p> key on the Image Viewer can Play or Pause a slide show and
the menu can adjust its playback speed.  The slideshow is the pictures
from the Thumbnail grid in order.  Therefore you can order the
slideshow by the filtering and sorting options of the grid.  The
defaults may work well while a random show would need I<Ungrouped>
galleries and I<Random> images.

Arrow key navigation and info cycling is available while the slideshow
plays.  Menu or escape back to the grid automatically pauses the show,
then you can B<Enter> and B<p> to continue playback from any point on
the grid.

Videos are previewed with a frame from the center of the time.
B<Enter> will play the video (B<Escape> to return) or you can hit B<v>
to toggle video autoplay.

=head1 TODO

Add [Duplicates]/{alone,hard links,soft links}/

Add [Places]/place names/ via GPS lat/lon (see Geo::LatLon2Place)

Add all Picasa features (stars, albums, faces, [uploads])

Add configuration options and documentation

Maybe add simple image edit options to the menu
